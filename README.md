# CIL-User-Showcase
A repository to showcase jupyter-notebooks created by users of the [Core Imaging Library](https://github.com/TomographicImaging/CIL). These notebooks are contributed by users of CIL.  Some have been lightly edited by CIL maintainers for clarity, but credit for the contents remains with their authors. 

For an interactive introduction to CIL, created by CIL developers,  see our [demo notebooks](https://github.com/TomographicImaging/CIL-Demos).
